# SPPU_2019_SE_Comp_Object_Oriented_Programming_Practicals

**GROUP - A**

Practical 1 : Implement a class Complex which represents the Complex Number data type. Implement the following
<br>1.	Constructor (including a default constructor which creates the complex number 0+0i).
<br>2.	Overload operator+ to add two complex numbers.
<br>3.	Overload operator* to multiply two complex numbers.
<br>4.	Overload operators << and >> to print and read Complex Numbers.

Practical 2 : Develop a program in C++ to create a database of studentâ€™s information system containing the following information: Name, Roll number, Class, Division, Date of Birth, Blood group, Contact address, Telephone number, Driving license no. and other. Construct the database with suitable member functions. Make use of constructor, default constructor, copy constructor, destructor, static member functions, friend class, this pointer, inline code and dynamic memory allocation operators-new and delete as well as exception handling.

Practical 3 : Imagine a publishing company which does marketing for book and audio cassette versions. Create a class publication that stores the title (a string) and price (type float) of publications. From this class derive two classes: book which adds a page count (type int) and tape which adds a playing time in minutes (type float). Write a program that instantiates the book and tape class, allows user to enter data and displays the data members. If an exception is caught, replace all the data member values with zero values

**GROUP - B**

Practical 4 : Write a C++ program that creates an output file, writes information to it, closes the file, open
it again as an input file and read the information from the file.

Practical 5 : Write a function template for selection sort that inputs, sorts and outputs an integer array and a float array.

**GROUP - C**

Practical 6 : Write C++ program using STL for sorting and searching user defined records such as Item records (Item code, name, cost, quantity etc) using vector container.
